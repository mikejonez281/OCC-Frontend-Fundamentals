Instructions:
Using JavaScript and DOM manipulation, achieve the following tasks without directly modifying the internal CSS or HTML files. Ensure all changes to CSS and HTML are dynamically applied through JavaScript:

1. Change the background color of the gallery wall to rgb(71, 18, 18).
2. Change the color of the frame of the second painting to "black".
3. Update the tag of the painting "The Milkmaid" to include the artist's name.
4. Remove the fourth painting along with its frame from the first row of paintings.
5. Add another painting and frame to the end of the first row with any famous painting and artist.
6. Update the tag of the first painting to include the name and artist.
7. Increase the width of the last frame from "300px" to "500px".
8. Change the picture in the last frame in the second row to "The Starry Night" (find a picture from the internet).
9. Send a screenshot of your output.

Place your JavaScript code in DOM-exercise.js to achieve these tasks.
